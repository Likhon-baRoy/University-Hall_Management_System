* What are we looking for?
The basic things that we're looking for is fulfilment of all facilities shown this video: https://youtu.be/5u11Gv-wc_U

** Fronted Facilities

[X] *Homepage:* This page represents: Hall facilities, information, helpline, visual representation of hall indoor & outdoor etc.

[X] *Visual Booking facility:* Allow users visual representation of rooms,
  something like: hotel online book with view system. Can filter/search for the specific rooms. Only rooms with available seat will shown in the booking page.

[X] *Fetch Booked Seat Data:*  When user checked for =Book=, user will redirect to registration page fetching Hall & Room into the form field.

[X] *User validity check:* Check If the user is registered under University. Then we'll let them in. Otherwise we'll show user is invalid. For this to work we keep separate user_type tables where we'll search for user_id & email of users in given user_type in the register field.

[X] *OTP verification:* OTP code will send on user given email with a time limit, If time expire, user have to request for a new OTP.

[-] *Online Payment:* On user successful registration user data will be stored in database
  but with inactive status. To activate account user have to pay the rent in
  advance. The status will automatically activate through online payment API token but as we could not use the paid API, so this  feature is missing. And have to it menualy from admin panel.

** Admin-panel

[X] *Notify on User Status Update:* On status update, user will get notified via email.

[X] *Only Active Status login facility:* If user status is active then user can login, otherwise user is restricted.

[X] *Dashboard graphical representation:* In user Dashboard we'll try to show some infos about hall, users ups-and-down etc through graphical representation.

[X] *Dynamic Permissions:* Admin can give role wise permissions to each user_type so that student can't get access of admin options.

[X] *Add Hall,Room,Seat Dynamically:* Permitted Admin can create/edit/update or publish/unpublish Hall,Room,Seat.
